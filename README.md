# Merry Marrow
A command-line tool to predict the survival rate of youth bone marrow transplants <3

## Overview
Hi! Merry Marrow is a deep-learning project created for TJHSST's 2023 Bioinformatics Hackathon. The goal was to create an accurate method of predicting the likelihood of a child surviving a bone marrow transplant (based on numerical info relating to the donor/recipient). The model attained a loss of less than 30, which is quite accurate on the scale of a large classification.

## Directions
- Ensure that you have Python 3 installed, along with the necessary packages
- Download the latest version of the repository.
- Extract the download and run the app.py file (Make sure that the TF model is in the same directory and you are running the file in its shared directory).
- Enter all of the requested parameters (MUST be numbers).
- Receive your prediction!

Enjoy!
